1. In the Model File
    1) Create Contact struct, with constants from the contactsDict
    2) Create static func to getAllContacts and returning as array of allContact
    3) Create empty array of all the contacts
    4) Use for loop to iterate the dictionary, for each key and value in the dict, create a newContact constant as a newElement.
    5) add this newContact into the Contact array, and return all the contact

2. Add Unit Testing:
    1)    on Left Pane, Diamond Shape, '+', add unit testing
    2)    go to Tests Folder, delete all func test that came with it.
    3)    under 'import XCTest' -> @testable import ContactsAppTwo
    4)    Write your Test function ->
    5)    func testGetContacts() {
    6)            //Arrange
    7)            let contactsCount = 20
    8)            //Act
    9)            let actualContactsCount = Contact.getAllContacts().count
    10)            //Assert
    11)            XCTAssertEqual(contactsCount, actualContactsCount, "Value should be equal")
    12)        }
    Make sure you run with both examples: failed and success

3. Storyboard and ContactsVC:
    1)    Refactor your VC to 'ContactsVC' then add TableViewObject, set all constraints to 0, so it will bound to view
    2)    change to 1 for Prototype Cell. Inside tbl view cell -> change style to subtitle and set identifier to 'contactCell'
    3)    Connect it with outlet property, then create private var 'allContacts'
    4)    create func loadAllContacts
    5)    Create Extension ContactsVC with UITblViewDatasource and UITblViewDelegate, and fill them with protocol stubs -> number of rows and indexPath
    6)    inside the cellForRowAt -> create indexPath to deque reuseable cell, populate cell with fullName and phone #.
    7)
